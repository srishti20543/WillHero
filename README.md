## Key Features

1. **OOP Concepts**: Implemented using Data Abstraction, Encapsulation, Inheritance, and Polymorphism.
2. **Hero Movement**: Hero always jumps in place and moves forward on input.
3. **Enemies and Obstacles**: Includes two types of Orcs and one type of obstacle (falling platforms).
4. **Weapons and Chests**: Hero can collect coins and weapons from chests. Weapons can be upgraded.
5. **Collision Detection**: Implemented for Hero-Enemy, Hero-Obstacle, and Hero-Island interactions.
6. **Game Mechanics**: Includes gravity simulation, resurrection feature, and end-game condition.
7. **Serialization**: Game state can be saved and loaded at any point.

## Problems Faced and Solutions

- **Collision Detection**: Implemented using invisible boundaries and rectangles.
- **Gravity Implementation**: Managed through physics simulation.
- **State Serialization**: Handled using transient properties and initialization.
- **Scene Transitions**: Ensured data persistence across scenes using toggle functions.

## Bonus Features

- **Loading Page**: Added a splash screen for game loading.
- **Weapon Selection**: Allows players to choose their weapons.
- **Enhanced Animations**: Includes smooth transitions, live environment effects, and coin collection animations.
- **Main Menu Page**: An animated and interactive main menu.

## How to Play

1. **Start Game**: Begin a new game from the main menu.
2. **Movement**: Use a single input to move the Hero forward.
3. **Combat**: Defeat Orcs by pushing them into the abyss or using weapons.
4. **Collect Coins and Weapons**: Gather items from chests to aid in progression.
5. **Defeat the Boss**: Overcome the Boss Orc to win the game.
6. **Save/Load Game**: Save your progress and load previous games at any point.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository: `git clone <repository-url>`
2. Open the project in your preferred IDE.
3. Ensure JavaFX is properly set up.
4. Run the main application file to start the game.
